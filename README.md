4-Stage Pipelined Processor Design

A 4-stage pipelined processor is an efficient architecture designed to execute basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD. Pipeline architecture enhances instruction throughput by dividing the execution process into multiple stages, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages.

Pipeline Stages:

1. Fetch (IF - Instruction Fetch):

In this stage, the processor retrieves the instruction from memory using the Program Counter (PC).

The instruction is then passed to the next stage for decoding.



2. Decode (ID - Instruction Decode):

The fetched instruction is decoded to determine the operation type (e.g., ADD, SUB, LOAD).

Operands are identified, and control signals are generated.



3. Execute (EX - Execution):

Arithmetic and logical operations are performed in the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

For ADD and SUB instructions, the ALU processes the operands.

For LOAD, the effective memory address is calculated.



4. Write-Back (WB - Write Back):

The result from the ALU or memory is written back to the destination register.




Key Features:

Instruction Overlap: Multiple instructions are processed simultaneously at different stages, improving throughput.

Hazard Handling: Techniques like data forwarding and hazard detection are implemented to manage pipeline hazards.

Simulation: Each stage's functionality will be demonstrated through simulation, showing instruction flow and how dependencies are managed.


Deliverable:

The final deliverable will include a functional design of the 4-stage pipeline processor, along with a simulation demonstrating each stage's operation. The design will showcase instruction execution flow, pipeline performance, and hazard resolution mechanisms.

Upon successful completion of the project and submission of the deliverable, a completion certificate will be issued at the end of the internship by CODTECH.
